Panax PSR PHP Web and REST Framework
==================

A PSR compliant PHP framework using state-of-art PHP modules.

The effort with **Panax** is to create a PHP framework, built in complete compliance with available standards within the PHP community. Where standards do not exists, we use documented best practice and existing state-of-art PHP modules available in the open source community.

Every decision taken, when designing and building the framework, is documented in the Wiki.

This work is mainly for research and educational purpose. However, the end game is to build a solid and stable foundation for a modern well-documented standardized modular state-of-art PHP framework that the PHP opensource community can be proud of.
